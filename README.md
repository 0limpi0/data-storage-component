## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There are the mobile and desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This means that I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information I needed, such as color palette and fonts in order to build this component.
